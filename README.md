# sync-install

This is a small ultity program that I made in order to make my life just a bit easier by installing various software programs that I use reguarly but are not necessarily included in the default instalation of whatever Linux distro I may be using at the time.

Now, this small ulitity program could actually be used for a variety of use cases. For instance, I could create a forensics focused listing of tools that can turn any Linux distro into a forensic distrubution, or I could use it for turning any Linux distro into a penetration focused distrubtion like Kali Linux and so on. 

As I further develop and hone this ulitity program I am sure it may evolve into something that a lot of other people would find useful.
